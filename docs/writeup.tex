\section{Introduction}

In our group project, we will improve Peerster's file-sharing capabilities by making the service more reliable, more scalable and more secure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To improve scalability and to distribute the workload among hosts, a file's chunks aren't all hosted by the same node, but rather by multiple nodes.
    This is done by storing the chunks in a distributed hash table when a user want to share a file.
    The hash table uses redundancy to prevent data loss in the case that a node shuts down.
    \item Chunks are transferred and stored by hosts in an encrypted manner to guarantee confidentiality.
    In addition, each chunk gets a cryptographic signature to ensure integrity.
    \item Peerster's blockchain is augmented to store information about the nodes, such as their public keys.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related work}

The central theme at the heart of our project is peer-to-peer file sharing, which has been around for decades and has been explored extensively.
Napster, released in 1999, was one of the services that popularized peer-to-peer file sharing over the Internet.
It used a centralized model, where a central server connected users searching for a file with peers providing the same file.
